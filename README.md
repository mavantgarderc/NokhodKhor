# NokhodKhor

A no-frills tribute to an all-time classic: Pac-Man.

---

##  What This Is

- A personal, unapologetically un-professional homage to Pac-Man built in Python.
- Lightweight, simple, and nostalgic.
- Perfect if you're into exploring game mechanics without unnecessary complexity.

---

##  Repository Overview

```
.
├── main.py    — the game loop & core logic
├── board.py   — defines the playing field and behavior
└── assets/

```

---

## Pre-Requisites

- You need Python—3.9+ is a safe bet (test goes up to your version).
- No dependencies needed; standard libraries used. It is a tribute project, not a production-grade AAA.

* **How to Run**

1. `git clone https://github.com/mavantgarderc/NokhodKhor.git`
2. `cd NokhodKhor`
3. `python main.py`

##  Why You Should Care (if you should)

- Great for learning: game loop design, collision logic, state management.
- Minimal code—perfect for code archaeology or quick experimentation.
- Peek under the hood of a Pac-Man clone without corporate bloat.

---

##  Looking Ahead

Not a roadmap—but open to pull requests if someone wants to:

- Polish graphics or audio
- Add levels, high-score tracking, or AI ghosts
- Modularize code for extendability

Not promising anything, just saying: contributions accepted.


>**TL;DR**: It’s a lean, mean Pac-Man homage in Python. No nonsense, no frills—just code. Dive in if you’re curious or want to build on it.
